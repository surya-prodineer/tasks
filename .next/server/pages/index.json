The two next films in the series were both shown in 2014, one subtitled \"Kyoto Inferno\" and the subsequent one \"The Legend Ends.\" This current title subtitled \"The Final\" is the fourth and concluding installment, while a fifth was released at the same time in Japan, a prequel subtitled \"The Beginning.\"</p>\n<p>Kenshin Himura (Takeru Sato) and his gang of friends from the first three films are all still here. They were: fencing instructor Kaoru (Emi Takei), street fighter Sonosuke (Munetaka Anoki), doctor Megumi (Yu Aoi), young boy Yahiko (Kaito Oyagi), and police chief Hajime Saito (Yosuke Eguchi). His recent allies from the third film, Misao (Tao Tsuchiya) and Aoshi (Yusuke Iseya) from Kyoto, also drop in for a fantastic fight scene.</p>\n<p>Violent attacks have been launched against various neighbors and friends of Kenshin by a gang of crazy warriors and their army of minions. It turned out that the terrorists were all under the instruction of one bitterly angry young man named Yukishiro Enishi (Mackenyu Arata) who held Kenshin responsible for the death of someone very precious to him. So much was his wrath that Enishi not only wanted Kenshin to suffer but everyone around him as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"embed-block\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n1iL-DveFUA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p class=\"embed-block__description\">Rurouni Kenshin</p></div>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Even though it had been seven long years since the last RK film, once one sees the familiar cast of characters, you will remember all their memorable idiosyncrasies, as well as the basics of the continuing story.

One of the bad guys even had an automatic cannon and machine gun appended to his right arm which he can shoot at will wreaking widespread damage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kenshin vs. Enishi was a study in contrasts. Takeru Sato as Kenshin was more of the calm, generally laidback sort, only accelerating into rapidfire action when provoked into a sword fight. Meanwhile, Mackenyu Arata's Enishi was jacked up all the way, explosive when fighting, intense even if he was only brooding. Enishi and his mad allies looked like emo boy band jocks but in full Edward Scissorhands hairstyles and facial makeup.&nbsp;</p>","slugline":"Netflix review: Rurouni Kenshin","firstcreated":"2021-06-22T04:02:44.000Z","firstpublished":"2021-06-22T05:12:56.000Z","source":"Push","annotations":[],"profile":"NewsArticle","associations":{"_id":"60d2101f59fa5a323bc52129","articleImage":{"guid":"tag:18.136.165.153:5000:2021:7e4c46b0-187d-46b3-a086-59690c307f27","version":"2","type":"picture","versioncreated":"2021-06-22T04:06:06+0000","language":"en","headline":"Rurouni Kenshin","urgency":3,"pubstatus":"usable","mimetype":"image/webp","firstcreated":"2021-06-22T04:06:03+0000","source":"Superdesk","body_text":"Rurouni Kenshin","priority":6,"renditions":{"original":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/2021062205064/5334e6f5c775bafc6e0ec9a9c1bc83ffe3ec8e7c7d081f8cc54e1046cddbb768","width":950,"height":633,"mimetype":"image/webp","poi":{"x":475,"y":316},"media":"2021062205064/5334e6f5c775bafc6e0ec9a9c1bc83ffe3ec8e7c7d081f8cc54e1046cddbb768"},"viewImage":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/2021062205064/d45ea4302e8d18ab7a2d9c90a8429c51507a408467a8c0831de15dca20542fd3.png","width":640,"height":426,"mimetype":"image/png","media":"2021062205064/d45ea4302e8d18ab7a2d9c90a8429c51507a408467a8c0831de15dca20542fd3.png"},"baseImage":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/2021062205064/28add07f4998e2e02de09817456f2ee4542976ceb0c8b3559e063c4a4372ffff.png","width":1400,"height":932,"mimetype":"image/png","media":"2021062205064/28add07f4998e2e02de09817456f2ee4542976ceb0c8b3559e063c4a4372ffff.png"},"FIXME":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/2021062205064/a198d5427a0a1f1df0f9e939c451e947c3ca2771d9d2011d0ef967af90caef14.png","width":800,"height":600,"mimetype":"image/png","media":"2021062205064/a198d5427a0a1f1df0f9e939c451e947c3ca2771d9d2011d0ef967af90caef14.png"}},"order":0,"description_text":"Rurouni Kenshin","copyrightholder":"","copyrightnotice":"","usageterms":"","genre":[{"code":"Article","name":"Article (news)"}],"products":[],"subscribers":[]}},"priority":5,"subject":[{"code":"01021000","name":"entertainment (general)"}],"service":[{"code":"f1","name":"Default","scheme":"categories"}],"description_html":"<p>Quiet as it was, the serene ending was emotionally satisfying as it closed this saga.

One silent type, plus one or two louder counterparts, usually equals a kind of humble harmony. Harpo Marx’s muteness seems to turn up Groucho and Chico’s physical volume. Silent Bob makes Jay’s stoned doofery almost sentimental. Even Teller brings a shade of mystery to his idiot co-star. The math is elusive, but when the calculus works out right, the formula can give the vague texture of poetry to anything from a card trick to a hit in the nuts.</p>\n<p>It takes a strong, steady grip to carry a well-worn bit from the screen to pop music — a format that’s accepting of, though not exactly kind to gimmickry — yet the brothers Ron and Russell Mael, who play in a glamorous and confusing band called Sparks, have handily taken the heritage across the medium and built something like a home out of it. Across much of the visual evidence of the band’s existence in the past half-century — music videos, public appearances, late-night talk shows, the interiors and exteriors of each album — the ancient equation is apparent.In their 1974 debut on “Top of the Pops,” they perform “This Town Ain’t Big Enough for Both of Us” — a baroque, vaudevillian, acrobatically difficult-to-sing pop song — as Ron leers silently at Russell with blood in his eyes. Russell looks a bit like Jim Morrison; Ron, an underfed Chaplin. Staring from his seat at the piano, Ron’s gelid gaze is sphinxian, murderous, as if he would love to get the song over with and put a knife in his brother’s chest. (A few albums later, a press shoot would feature a handful of photos of Russell stabbing Ron in the back with a cleaver.) Volumes of their videos seem almost canonically devoted to both partial silence and total violence. There’s footage of Ron pulping Russell in a boxing ring, Ron getting pied, Russell getting made into a hideous puppet. My favorite album cover of theirs — “Propaganda,” from 1974 — has them ripping across the English Channel while bound and gagged on a speedboat.</p>","slugline":"The Sparks Brothers","firstcreated":"2021-06-20T16:23:12.000Z","firstpublished":"2021-06-20T16:48:26.000Z","source":"Push","annotations":[],"profile":"NewsArticle","associations":{"_id":"60d2101f59fa5a323bc52137","articleImage":{"guid":"tag:18.136.165.153:5000:2021:f5e198b4-b914-4969-9404-f27956305cdd","version":"2","type":"picture","versioncreated":"2021-06-20T16:47:27+0000","language":"en","headline":"Art","urgency":3,"pubstatus":"usable","mimetype":"image/jpeg","firstcreated":"2021-06-20T16:47:26+0000","source":"Superdesk","body_text":"Art","priority":6,"renditions":{"original":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620170644/2f6c5cb50d597b422386f09e8bad91035cb76020fc52af877fcaa27f4d876a23.jpg","width":916,"height":611,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","poi":{"x":458,"y":305},"media":"20210620170644/2f6c5cb50d597b422386f09e8bad91035cb76020fc52af877fcaa27f4d876a23.jpg"},"viewImage":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620170644/eb4f09ee03abe203dcdf2149d6f9db821d3d4be3f54b731e2fa9d2c7baad4aba.jpg","width":640,"height":426,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","media":"20210620170644/eb4f09ee03abe203dcdf2149d6f9db821d3d4be3f54b731e2fa9d2c7baad4aba.jpg"},"baseImage":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620170644/287d7b6628693de5a4ef6a3356a5b81628c89909e199e1ce84a4a1c7ddb7d567.jpg","width":1400,"height":933,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","media":"20210620170644/287d7b6628693de5a4ef6a3356a5b81628c89909e199e1ce84a4a1c7ddb7d567.jpg"},"FIXME":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620170644/947c0eb9c2d358b260da1a930776c33835c5a6f6ab84ae45cb4f55fba1571260.jpg","width":800,"height":600,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","media":"20210620170644/947c0eb9c2d358b260da1a930776c33835c5a6f6ab84ae45cb4f55fba1571260.jpg"}},"order":0,"description_text":"Art","copyrightholder":"","copyrightnotice":"","usageterms":"","genre":[{"code":"Article","name":"Article (news)"}],"products":[],"subscribers":[]}},"priority":5,"subject":[{"code":"01020000","name":"arts (general)"}],"service":[{"code":"f1","name":"Default","scheme":"categories"}],"description_html":"<p>Gimmicky though it may be, the cinematic tradition of grouping men who know both when and when not to shut up will always feel like solid comic algebra.

Williams High graduate seeking to make his first Olympic team, has dominated the world in the 200 for three years and has proved a force in the 4x100 relay, winning the 2019 world championship in both. The 100 has proved more vexing. He believes he has made progress in training, but Lyles had not broken 10 seconds in the event this year before the trials. More than 20 American men had run faster in the 100 than him. A loaded American field probably will require Lyles to surpass his personal best of 9.86 seconds.</p>\n<p>Is the gold medal in the 100 still a goal?

She asked Lyles, “Why are you concerned about the 100?” Lyles told her his competitive instincts took over, and he believed he was good at it.</p>\n<p>“And then she asked me if I was nervous about the 200,” Lyles said. “I said, ‘Heck no.’ She’s like, ‘Well, why are you worried about your side chick?’ I said, ‘You know what, that’s a good point.’ I ain’t worried no more. Whatever I get is what I get.”</p>\n<p>What Lyles got Saturday was his best 100 in more than two years. Running in a jaguar-print suit, he recovered from a subpar start to finish behind Ronnie Baker (9.88) and Fred Kerley (9.93). According to the NBC broadcast, Lyles reached a top speed of 26.3 mph, fastest in the field.</p>","slugline":"Noah Lyles at the U.S. track and field trials","firstcreated":"2021-06-20T15:50:38.000Z","firstpublished":"2021-06-20T15:53:13.000Z","source":"Push","annotations":[],"profile":"NewsArticle","associations":{"_id":"60d2101f59fa5a323bc5213a","articleImage":{"guid":"tag:18.136.165.153:5000:2021:95f90017-9044-4b8b-a950-d5aeb1e060f7","version":"2","type":"picture","versioncreated":"2021-06-20T15:51:54+0000","language":"en","headline":"Noah","urgency":3,"pubstatus":"usable","mimetype":"image/webp","firstcreated":"2021-06-20T15:51:52+0000","source":"Superdesk","body_text":"Noah","priority":6,"renditions":{"original":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620160648/de9688184c4204365a5a7fc51edba27da52e432a81d3f030c06fa52c73ffb7f3","width":916,"height":611,"mimetype":"image/webp","poi":{"x":458,"y":305},"media":"20210620160648/de9688184c4204365a5a7fc51edba27da52e432a81d3f030c06fa52c73ffb7f3"},"viewImage":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620160648/8c5e5057de3e5e5c55b167cfd45620bf3f2b4694304fa21faa3cec826ad02559.png","width":640,"height":426,"mimetype":"image/png","media":"20210620160648/8c5e5057de3e5e5c55b167cfd45620bf3f2b4694304fa21faa3cec826ad02559.png"},"baseImage":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620160648/d6ea169ae57c6dede5f69422c06f7fd208387baa29fde001d6eca3fb8abb4570.png","width":1400,"height":933,"mimetype":"image/png","media":"20210620160648/d6ea169ae57c6dede5f69422c06f7fd208387baa29fde001d6eca3fb8abb4570.png"},"FIXME":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620160648/a1d3c538e3501a10778b5fc30b08c57388f57565a0b6cb8b367530fd7faf93df.png","width":800,"height":600,"mimetype":"image/png","media":"20210620160648/a1d3c538e3501a10778b5fc30b08c57388f57565a0b6cb8b367530fd7faf93df.png"}},"order":0,"description_text":"Noah","copyrightholder":"","copyrightnotice":"","usageterms":"","genre":[{"code":"Article","name":"Article (news)"}],"products":[],"subscribers":[]}},"priority":5,"subject":[{"code":"15073000","name":"sports event"}],"service":[{"code":"f1","name":"Default","scheme":"categories"}],"description_html":"<p>Since at least early 2019, Noah Lyles has made it a mission to win three gold medals at the Tokyo <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/20/tokyo-olympics-2021-guide/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics</a>.

Schechter. “They could show a survey where it’s understood by over 80 percent people in the area that ‘Washington Football Team’ means the one in the National Football League and not any other.”</p>\n<p>Whatever the name ends up being, both experts noted it’s important for the team to register it. A registered trademark allows the holder to enforce it, which helps strengthen agreements with licensees like apparel companies, and discourages counterfeiters, such as vendors selling knockoff merchandise outside the stadium.</p>\n<p>The team could continue to use WFT as an unregistered trademark, but it would not be able to prevent others from using it, a scenario the TV show South Park played up <a href=\"https://southpark.cc.com/episodes/q743k3/south-park-go-fund-yourself-season-18-ep-1\" target=\"_blank\">in a 2014 episode</a> that mocked the team for losing the trademark to its former name.</p>\n<p>In another effort to sway the USPTO, the team could show its sales numbers for tickets and merchandise based on marketing around “Washington Football Team.” The team could also try to make WFT more distinctive by adding elements, such as a mascot. Vining noted that other filings by Snyder’s company, Pro Football, Inc., included phrases such as “Est. 1932,” suggesting the team could be probing the USPTO to figure out which signs of distinctiveness it will accept.</p>\n<p>The issue of McCauley’s previous registrations, Schechter said, will be harder to overcome and is more pressing. The team’s first move in what could become a lengthy process must be deciding how to deal with the wordmark, which puts the spotlight on McCaulay, who holds the trademark of “Washington Football Club.” The team could try to cancel McCaulay’s registration or buy him out.</p>\n<p>\"As we have told the team in the past, Mr. McCaulay is willing to discuss assigning his valuable registration,”

Filipinos worry more about getting infected by COVID-19 than those who were anxious of possibly contracting previous prevalent viruses such as swine flu, bird flu, and SARS.</p>\n<p>According to SWS, 92% of Visayas residents said they are absolutely or somewhat worried over contracting the virus, followed by Mindanao (90%), Balance Luzon (88%), and Metro Manila (85%).</p>\n<p>The survey was

speedy emergency use authorization, or EUA, from the government for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate after safely completing phase II trials.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Developing its own vaccine has been a major goal of Taiwan's government, though it also has ordered some 20 million shots from Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and the COVAX global sharing scheme for lower income countries.</p>\n<p>Only about 3% of Taiwan's 23.5 million people have received at least one shot, with further supplies held up by global production problems, as the island deals with a spike in domestic cases after months of relative safety.</p>\n<p>Medigen's chief executive, Charles Chen, told a briefing they were pleased with the phase II results and would be submitting an EUA request to Taiwan's food and drug administration soon.</p>\n<p>\"Safety is very important, and our vaccine is very safe,\" he said, adding he was \"very optimistic\" about getting EUA.</p>\n<p>Chen said that ultimately the company was preparing to produce 100 million doses, and export them to the small number of countries with which Chinese-claimed Taiwan has diplomatic relations after the vaccine gets international regulatory approval.</p>\n<p>Taiwan's government last month signed deals with Medigen, and another local firm, United Biomedical Inc, for five million doses each, and has agreements for another five million each, for a total of 20 million shots.</p>\n<p>Medigen says that more than 4,000 people participated in its second phase clinical trial and received two shots, and that it had seen no serious adverse reactions, with a placebo given to one in every seven participants.</p>\n<p>The recombinant protein vaccine has been developed in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health in the United States.</p>\n<p>Taiwan's government hopes to start administering the domestically developed vaccines next month.</p>\n<p>The government, however, has come under criticism from opposition parties after President Tsai Ing-wen pledged last month to start administering domestically developed vaccines in July before results of the second clinical trial were released.</p>\n<p>Tsai later said her government would strictly scrutinize the process under international scientific norms and put safety first.&nbsp;</p>","slugline":"Taiwan Medigen seeks usage

transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>Other recommendations for managing the transition due to the Mandanas Ruling include channeling the LGUs’ budgets to the pandemic response.</p>\n<p>Albay Representative Joey Salceda said the ruling could help generate more jobs in the countryside, but stressed the importance of collaboration between the national and local governments.</p>\n<p>\"In the
