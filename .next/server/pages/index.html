Across much of the visual evidence of the band’s existence in the past half-century — music videos, public appearances, late-night talk shows, the interiors and exteriors of each album — the ancient equation is apparent.In their 1974 debut on “Top of the Pops,” they perform “This Town Ain’t Big Enough for Both of Us” — a baroque, vaudevillian, acrobatically difficult-to-sing pop song — as Ron leers silently at Russell with blood in his eyes. Russell looks a bit like Jim Morrison; Ron, an underfed Chaplin. Staring from his seat at the piano, Ron’s gelid gaze is sphinxian, murderous, as if he would love to get the song over with and put a knife in his brother’s chest. (A few albums later, a press shoot would feature a handful of photos of Russell stabbing Ron in the back with a cleaver.) Volumes of their videos seem almost canonically devoted to both partial silence and total violence. There’s footage of Ron pulping Russell in a boxing ring, Ron getting pied, Russell getting made into a hideous puppet. My favorite album cover of theirs — “Propaganda,” from 1974 — has them ripping across the English Channel while bound and gagged on a speedboat.\u003c/p\u003e","slugline":"The Sparks Brothers","firstcreated":"2021-06-20T16:23:12.000Z","firstpublished":"2021-06-20T16:48:26.000Z","source":"Push","annotations":[],"profile":"NewsArticle","associations":{"_id":"60d2101f59fa5a323bc52137","articleImage":{"guid":"tag:18.136.165.153:5000:2021:f5e198b4-b914-4969-9404-f27956305cdd","version":"2","type":"picture","versioncreated":"2021-06-20T16:47:27+0000","language":"en","headline":"Art","urgency":3,"pubstatus":"usable","mimetype":"image/jpeg","firstcreated":"2021-06-20T16:47:26+0000","source":"Superdesk","body_text":"Art","priority":6,"renditions":{"original":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620170644/2f6c5cb50d597b422386f09e8bad91035cb76020fc52af877fcaa27f4d876a23.jpg","width":916,"height":611,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","poi":{"x":458,"y":305},"media":"20210620170644/2f6c5cb50d597b422386f09e8bad91035cb76020fc52af877fcaa27f4d876a23.jpg"},"viewImage":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620170644/eb4f09ee03abe203dcdf2149d6f9db821d3d4be3f54b731e2fa9d2c7baad4aba.jpg","width":640,"height":426,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","media":"20210620170644/eb4f09ee03abe203dcdf2149d6f9db821d3d4be3f54b731e2fa9d2c7baad4aba.jpg"},"baseImage":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620170644/287d7b6628693de5a4ef6a3356a5b81628c89909e199e1ce84a4a1c7ddb7d567.jpg","width":1400,"height":933,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","media":"20210620170644/287d7b6628693de5a4ef6a3356a5b81628c89909e199e1ce84a4a1c7ddb7d567.jpg"},"FIXME":{"href":"http://18.136.165.153:5000/api/upload-raw/20210620170644/947c0eb9c2d358b260da1a930776c33835c5a6f6ab84ae45cb4f55fba1571260.jpg","width":800,"height":600,"mimetype":"image/jpeg","media":"20210620170644/947c0eb9c2d358b260da1a930776c33835c5a6f6ab84ae45cb4f55fba1571260.jpg"}},"order":0,"description_text":"Art","copyrightholder":"","copyrightnotice":"","usageterms":"","genre":[{"code":"Article","name":"Article (news)"}],"products":[],"subscribers":[]}},"priority":5,"subject":[{"code":"01020000","name":"arts (general)"}],"service":[{"code":"f1","name":"Default","scheme":"categories"}],"description_html":"\u003cp\u003eGimmicky though it may be, the cinematic tradition of grouping men who know both when and when not to shut up will always feel like solid comic algebra.
